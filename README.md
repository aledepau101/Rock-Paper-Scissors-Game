# Rock Paper Scissors Game ðŸŽ®

A simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built with **JavaScript** that lets a human player compete against the computer in five rounds. The program uses basic browser prompts, alerts, and console logs for interaction.

I made this simple program to practice my new aquired skills in Javascript.

##How It Works

The game runs for **5 rounds**, where:
1. The player is prompted to choose between **paper**, **scissors**, or **rock**.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three choices.
3. The game compares both choices and determines the winner of each round.
4. After all 5 rounds are played, the game displays the **final score** and declares the overall winner.
